#       dcache submit bugreport


#  ---- Paths to be reported
#
#   This property declares which paths in the file system shall be
#   reported. Every file under such a path will be reported.
#   If you use the selection mode of the bug report command you will
#   be asked for every single file whether it shall be reported.
