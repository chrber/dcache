#
#       dcache submit bugreport


#  ---- Paths to be reported
#
#   This property declares which paths in the file system shall be
#   reported. Every file under such a path will be reported.
#   If you use the selection mode of the bug report command you will
#   be asked for every single file whether it shall be reported.

#  ---- Command Results to be reported
#
#   In this property you can specify the description and the command
#   that shall be executed. Please adhere to this format:

#   Each line EXCEPT the last one must end with a newline separator.
#   "Description of Command" can consist of an arbitrary string while
#   "Command to execute" needs to be a executable command that returns
#   0 as its exit value.
